# SearchMe
To run the app you must create an account in the prompt that will appear on the first launch.
It is important to state that the password must be at least 7 characters long, due to firebase password restrictions.

For demo purposes, there is already an account:
teste@ua.pt
1234567

The needed permission is the location of the device where the app is Running.
There is already a given number of "SearchMe" markers on the university.

There are 3 main panels:
The main one where it is possible to view the minimap as well as hidden and found caches
The map one, a bigger and more accurate version of the minimap where you can click on the markers and travel via google maps app
The upload page, where you can upload a new cache by giving a name as well as some coords and a URL for a picture. (there is a bug where firebase doesnt let to upload the marker 
to the database)
